This is just a cheesey one-night hack, so there's only minimal documentation.

Requirements: ffmpeg (`sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg virtualenv-python` on
Ubuntu), a Linux laptop with a webcam accessible via '/dev/video'.

Quick start:

    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./bin/runretro.sh

Then connect a web browser to the ip:port that the aforementioned script
spits out.
